- 👋 Hi, I’m @LucasLassiter
- 👀 I’m interested in pretty much everything with computers, and Onewheels
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Django
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Newpipe, it seems really interesting, but honestly I need help
- 📫 How to reach me, idk if you can dm github accounts but if you can, that'd work
